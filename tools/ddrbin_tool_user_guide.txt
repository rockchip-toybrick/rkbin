1. modify "ddrbin_param.txt", choose ddr frequency, uart info.
2. run "ddrbin_tool" with argument 1: ddrbin_param.txt, argument 2: ddr bin file.
   like: ./ddrbin_tool ddrbin_param.txt px30_ddr_333MHz_v1.13.bin

support following chip:
PX30：ddr bin version should be released later than V1.11.  Support modify uart info only.
RK1808: ddr bin version should be released later than V1.03. Support modify uart info and ddr frequency. ddr freq should be one of 333,400,533,666,786,933.
RK322x: ddr bin version should be released later than V1.08. Support modify uart info and ddr frequency. These is no limit to ddr frequency.
RK322xh: ddr bin version should be released later than V1.14. Support modify uart info only.
RK3288:  ddr bin version should be released later than V1.07. Support modify uart info only.
RK3308: ddr bin version should be released later than V1.28. Support modify uart info and ddr frequency. ddr freq should be one of 225,294,393,451,589.
RK3326：ddr bin version should be released later than V1.11.  Support modify uart info only.
RK3368: ddr bin version should be released later than V2.04. Support modify uart info and ddr frequency. These is no limit to ddr frequency.
RK3328: ddr bin version should be released later than V1.14. Support modify uart info only.
RK3399: ddr bin version should be released later than V1.20. Support modify uart info only.
RK3399PRO NPU: ddr bin version should be released later than V1.03. Support modify uart info and ddr frequency. ddr freq should be one of 333,400,533,666,786,933.

ddrbin_param.txt:
start tag: keep default value. Do not modify it.
ddr2_freq： ddr2 frequency,  unit:MHz.
lp2_freq：lpddr2 frequency,  unit:MHz.
ddr3_freq：ddr3 frequency,  unit:MHz.
lp3_freq：lpddr3 frequency,  unit:MHz.
ddr4_freq：ddr4 frequency,  unit:MHz.
lp4_freq：lpddr4 frequency,  unit:MHz.

If ddr*_freq/lp*_freq is set to 0, it's frequency will keep the same with the ddr bin frequency.

uart id：uart number. 0 for uart0, 1 for uart1, 2 for uart2..., 0xf will disable uart.
uart iomux：uart iomux info, 0 for uartn_m0, 1 for uartn_m1, 2 for uartn_m2...(like uart2_m0, uart2_m1,uart2_m2),
Or 1 for uartn_a, 2 for uartn_b, 3 for uartn_c.(like uar2a, uart2b, uart2c).
uart baudrate：uart baudrate should be 115200 or 1500000.

If both  of uart id, uart iomux and uart baudrate are set to 0, uart info will keep the same with ddr bin config.
